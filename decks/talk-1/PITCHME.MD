* Improving road attributes (names, lanes, restrictions, etc.)
* Correcting road connectivity issues
* Improving road classification consistency according to [OSM](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway) guidelines, and local [conventions](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Philippines/Mapping_conventions#Roads)
* Correcting road alignment issues
* Other one-off fixes

## Mapping Guidelines
The contributors will follow [OpenStreetMap](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highways), regional, and [national](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Philippines/) practices, along with any other guidelines, as appropriate.
Note:
When in doubt, the contributors will use the existing tags and data which are used locally. The history in JOSM (ctrl-H) identifies what previous mappers added and their notes and/or explanations regarding changes made. This history can also show if a previous mapper has visited that area or has expert knowledge or sources.

## Tools
The data team will primarily use [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) for completing the task. JOSM has validation warnings for road networks and other possible issues that are important to prevent improper changes.

* [iD Editor](http://ideditor.com/)
* [Mapillary]()
* OsmAnd
* OSMContributor

## Changeset Comments
The contributors will include changeset comments that are in compliance with [OSM changeset guidelines](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_changeset_comments).

---
## Error Detection
The team will check for errors visually and using [JOSM validation warnings](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Validator) prior to committing the changeset.

In addition, validation and review will be made in accordance to task guidelines including the [OSM Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_Tasking_Manager/Validating_data) and [LearnOSM](http://learnosm.org/en/coordination/review/) validation guidelines

* How can we improve harmonization between OSM tags and DPWH classification (apart from `designation` tags)
* How do we build more inclusive communities?
* How to get grassroots campaign off the ground?
* So much online activism seems superficial. How can we make a difference?
